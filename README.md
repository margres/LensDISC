# LensDISC - Lensing DIffracatoin Solving Code

To start using this package download this folder and on the terminal run

- if you download with ssh:
```
pip3 install yourpath/LensDISC/

```
- if you download the zipped folder:
```
pip3 install yourpath/LensDISC-main/

```
where 'yourpath' has to be changed with the path of the just downloaded folder.

some apts need to be installed in order to have pretty plots:

```
sudo apt install texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended dvipng cm-super
```

Good lensing!
